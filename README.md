# CoronaWhy Common Research and Data Infrastructure
## What is CoronaWhy?
CoronaWhy.org is a global volunteer organization dedicated to driving actionable insights into significant world issues using industry-leading data science, artificial intelligence and knowledge sharing. 
CoronaWhy was founded during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, following a White House call to help extract valuable data from more than 50,000 coronavirus-related scholarly articles, dating back decades.
Currently at over 1000 volunteers, CoronaWhy is composed of data scientists, doctors, epidemiologists, students, and various subject matter experts on everything from technology and engineering to communications and program management.

## What has CoronaWhy produced so far?

Read about our [creations](https://github.com/CoronaWhy/covid-19-infrastructure/blob/master/Creations.md) before you start.

# CoronaWhy infrastructure setup 

The infrastructure can be setup locally and exposed as a number of CoronaWhy services using traefik tool.

You need to specify the value of "traefikhost" before you'll start to deploy the infrastructure:

```export traefikhost=lab.coronawhy.org``` or ```export traefikhost=localhost```

download all CoronaWhy notebooks
```
./build-coronawhy-infra.sh 
```

then you simply run

```docker-compose up```

after that there would be exposed next CoronaWhy services:

- Airflow http://airflow.apps.coronawhy.org (takes some time to launch)
- Whoami http://whoami.apps.coronawhy.org (simple webserver returning host stats)
- CoronaWhy API http://api.apps.coronawhy.org (FastAPI with Swagger)
- Elasticsearch http://es.apps.coronawhy.org
- SPARQL http://sparql.apps.coronawhy.org (Virtuoso as a service)
- INDRA http://indra.apps.coronawhy.org (INDRA REST API https://indra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest_api.html)
- Grlc http://grlc.apps.coronawhy.org (SPARQL queries into RESTful APIs convertor)
- Doccano http://doccano.apps.coronawhy.org
- Jupyter http://jupyter.apps.coronawhy.org (look for token in the logs)
- OCR Tesseract http://ocr.tesseract.apps.coronawhy.org (OCR as a service)
- Portainer http://portainer.apps.coronawhy.org
- Traefik dashboard is available at http://apps.coronawhy.org:8080 (not secure setup)
- Kibana http://kibana.apps.coronawhy.org

Warning: in the example all infrastructure components deployed on *.apps.coronawhy.org, you should be able to get a local deployment on *.localhost (doccano.localhost, etc) or *.lab.coronawhy.org 

## CoronaWhy datasets

CoronaWhy community is building an Infrastructure for Open Science that can be distributed and scaled up in the future and reused for other important tasks like cancer research. The vision of the community is to build it completely from Open Source components, all data should be published data in FAIR way and keep all available provenance information.

We're using [Harvard Data Commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2yEvgT7_9Q&t=334s) as a foundation that allows all CoronaWhy members to work together. We’re building a different services and running an experimental Labs and our data infrastructure is something common and reusable, a place where all research groups are sharing the same resources. It’s build on top of Dataverse data repository developed by Harvard University and available on [datasets.coronawhy.org](datasets.coronawhy.org). 

CoronaWhy also maintaining various APIs to produce an aggregated COVID-19 datasets. You can access the data by querying CoronaWhy Data API with using country codes, for example, FRA for France [http://api.apps.coronawhy.org/country/FRA](http://api.apps.coronawhy.org/country/FRA)

## OpenLink Virtuoso triplestore

We are providing [Virtuoso as a service](https://sparql.labs.coronawhy.org) with public [SPARQL Endpoint](https://sparql.labs.coronawhy.org/sparql) that offers an HTTP-based Query Service that operates on Entity Relationship Types (Relations) represented as RDF sentence collections using the SPARQL Query Language. https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com

You can run a simple [SPARQL query](https://sparql.labs.coronawhy.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=&query=select+*+from+%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.coronawhy.org%3E+where+%7B%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Fo%7D&should-sponge=&format=text%2Fhtml&timeout=0&debug=on) to get some overview of triples from CoronaWhy Knowledge Graph.

## Kibana

Kibana deployed as a community service connected to CoronaWhy Elasticsearch on [https://kibana.labs.coronawhy.org](https://kibana.labs.coronawhy.org)
Allows to visualize Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack so you can do anything from tracking query load to understanding the way requests flow through your apps.
https://www.elastic.co/kibana

## BEL

BEL Commons 3.0 available as a service [https://bel.labs.coronawhy.org](https://bel.labs.coronawhy.org)

An environment for curating, validating, and exploring knowledge assemblies encoded in Biological Expression Language (BEL) to support elucidating disease-specific, mechanistic insight.

You can watch the [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHhuVBpoKdI&feature=youtu.be) and read [Corona BEL Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/180gdZMs6AmNi200CTCsMoxGFNPoiE8xxqzG6SCvIQ18/edit#heading=h.kovvpz3y508q) if you want to know more.

### INDRA

INDRA deployed as a service on [https://indra.labs.coronawhy.org/indra](https://indra.labs.coronawhy.org).

INDRA (Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler) generates executable models of pathway dynamics from natural language (using the TRIPS and REACH parsers), and BioPAX and BEL sources (including the Pathway Commons database and NDEx.

You can quickly test the service by running:
```
curl -X POST "https://indra.labs.coronawhy.org/bel/process_pybel_neighborhood" -H "accept: application/json" -H "content-type: application/json" -d "{ \"genes\": [ \"MAP2K1\" ]}" -l -o test_coronawhy_map2k1.json
```

Geoparser as a service [https://geoparser.labs.coronawhy.org](https://geoparser.labs.coronawhy.org)

The Geoparser is a software tool that can process information from any type of file, extract geographic coordinates, and visualize locations on a map. Users who are interested in seeing a geographical representation of information or data can choose to search for locations using the Geoparser, through a search index or by uploading files from their computer.
https://github.com/nasa-jpl-memex/GeoParser

### Tabula

Tabula allows you to extract data from PDF files into a CSV or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using a simple, easy-to-use interface. We deployed it as a [CoronaWhy service](http://tabula.labs.coronawhy.org) available for all community members. More information at [Tabula website](https://tabula.technology).
